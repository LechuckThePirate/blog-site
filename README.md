# blog-site
A small blog made with .NET, containerized, automatic deployment

This repository is a little showcase of a full stack application. It is a blog site, where you
can create, edit and delete posts. It is totally made with .NET 7, using WebAssembly for the frontend and SqlLite for the database.

As I am null in design, I used Bootstrap Studio to create the layout of the site.

Deployment is made automatically with GitHub Actions, using Docker and Docker Compose to build and run the application.
